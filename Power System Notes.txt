Power System Notes


Objectives Completed
	Design of analog circuitry for PSOC 4 ADC (Battery monitor), as well as approximate models for other components to use in modelling power consumption. (See Power System Schematic)
	
	Configuration of the PSOC 4 ADC (see printf_test workspace)
		Note: This compares the value of the input voltage to the 3.3V external reference on pin 1[7], and returns a 16 bit unsigned value.  0 corresponds to 0V, and 65,535 corresponds to 3.3V.  The Conversion factor is 1/19,859.  This will output the correct voltage.  
		
	Breadboard construction of the analog circuitry ,and test the serial output.

	
Current Objectives
	Finalize the tuning for the ADC.  Get it to print the correct voltages as compared to a multimeter reading.
	
	Sure up the serial output stream.  During testing it was fairly spotty, and started working randomly. 
	

Future Objectives 
	Integrate the ADC into the master controller programming, and make sure its information is relayed back to the base station. 
	
	Map out all of the components in the electronics box, and figure out the battery connectors.
